# HR-Data-Analysis-Using-MySQL

In This Project, I Developed An HR Data Analysis System Using MySQL To Gain Insights Into Employee Performance, Salary Distribution, And Departmental Trends. The Key Focus Is On Analyzing Employee Performance, Salaries, And Tenure, Which Helps Inform Strategic HR Decisions. And answered 15+ critical business questions using SQL aggregates, JOINs, CTE and subqueries.

üîç Project Overview
‚Ä¢Analyzed the average salary for employees in each department.
‚Ä¢Determined the number of employees hired each year to assess recruitment patterns.
‚Ä¢Identified the highest-performing employees and their distribution across departments.
‚Ä¢Examined the salary range and distribution, including finding the second-highest salary in each department.
‚Ä¢Explored the average salary by gender to understand pay distribution.
‚Ä¢Used window functions to rank employees by salary within each department.
‚Ä¢Year-Over-Year (YoY) Growth in Hiring
‚Ä¢Empowers HR departments to align their practices with company goals, improve employee satisfaction, and ensure efficient resource allocation by leveraging data. It provides a robust foundation for continuous HR improvement through data-driven insights.
